    <h1>About Voico Chrome Extension</h1>

    <p>
      If you're constantly typing out lengthy emails or find yourself
      struggling to keep up with note-taking during meetings, Voico 
      is the tool for you. All you need to do is install it from the 
      Chrome Web Store, and you're all set. Let's walk through how to
      get started with Voico.
    </p>

    <p>
      First things first, after installation, head over to the 
      extension options page(watch the video if you don't know where 
      this is). Here, you'll be setting up your preferred 
      language and your OpenAI API key. There's a broad array of 
      languages to choose from, catering to users from all around the
      world. Once you've picked your language, it's time to enter 
      your API key. Hit the save button, and you'll receive a 
      notification confirming that your credentials have been saved. 
      Remember, this setup is a one-time process.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Voico great?</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>User-Friendly:</b> Voico is straightforward and easy to 
        use. Simply install the extension, click on the record 
        button, and speak into your microphone. Voico will accurately
        transcribe your voice into text.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Universal:</b> Voico works on any website. Just click on 
        the input box where you want your transcribed text to appear 
        before you start recording. We ensure that your thoughts are 
        accurately transcribed and placed exactly where you want them.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Always Accessible:</b> In case a website doesn't permit 
        direct input from Voico, don't worry. We provide you with a 
        copy of the last five transcripts. All you need to do is 
        click the 'expand more' button on Voico to access them.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Customizable:</b> Voico offers a settings page where you 
        can select your preferred language. This customization 
        enhances transcription accuracy and speed, ensuring Voico 
        caters to your unique needs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Free:</b> Voico is absolutely free. All we require from 
        you is an API key from OpenAI to access their speech-to-text 
        service. Rest assured, your API key is never stored and is 
        only used during the transcription process. Any charges 
        incurred are from OpenAI, who offer new customers $5 of free 
        credits, equivalent to about 7-8 hours of free transcription.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Voico is designed to make your online interactions efficient 
      and seamless. Install Voico today and experience the magic of 
      hands-free typing!
