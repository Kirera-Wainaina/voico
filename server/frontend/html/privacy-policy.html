        to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and 
        defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our

    <h2>5. Children</h2>

    <p>
      Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We

      Party Sites”). The information that you share with Third Party 
      Sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and 
      terms of service of the Third Party Sites and not by this 
      Privacy Policy. By providing these links we do not imply that 
      we endorse or have reviewed these sites. Please contact the

      practices and policies.

    <p>

       and organizational measures to protect Personal Information 
       both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized 
       access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no 
       Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error 
       free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be 
       secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding 
       what information you send to us via the Service or email. In 
       addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any 
       privacy settings or security measures contained on the 
       Service, or third-party websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we 
      need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other 
      legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety
      and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. 
      How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number
      of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the 
      information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use 
      or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and 
      any legal requirements.
    </p>

      Personal Information will be processed and stored in our
