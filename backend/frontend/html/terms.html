      or violates any person’s rights; (ii) use the Services in any that violates

    <h2>3. Content</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Your Content.</b>
      You may provide input to the Services (“Input”), and receive output 
      generated and returned by the Services based on the Input (“Output”).
      Input and Output are collectively “Content.” As between the parties and 
      to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input. Subject 
      to your compliance with these Terms, Sizawi hereby assigns to you all
      its right, title and interest in and to Output. This means you can 
      use Content for any purpose, including commercial purposes such as

      enforce our policies. You are responsible for Content, including for 
      ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms.

      (“API Content”).
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) <b>Accuracy.</b>
      Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of 
      study. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our 
      Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does 
      not accurately reflect your input. You should evaluate the accuracy of 
      any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human 
      review of the Output.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Fees and Payments</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Fees and Billing.</b>
      Use of our services is free but you will pay all fees charged to your 
      OpenAI account according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing 
      page, or as otherwise agreed between the two parties. Failure to complete
      your due payment may result in our inability to offer our Services.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Security.</b>
      You must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help

      the vulnerability or breach.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Term and Termination</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Termination; Suspension.</b>
      These Terms take effect when you first use the Services and remain in 
      effect until terminated. You may terminate these Terms at any time for any 
      reason by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content. We may 
      terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach
      any of these sections, if there are changes in relationships with third 
      party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with 
      law or government requests. We may suspend your access to the Services 
      if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk 
      to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent 
      or could subject us or any third party to liability.
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) <b>Effect on Termination.</b>
      Upon termination, you will stop using the Services. The sections of these 
      Terms which by their nature should survive termination or expiration should 
      survive, including but not limited to Sections 3 and 5-9.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Indemnification; Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitations on Liability</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Indemnity.</b>
      You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our 
      personnel, from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including 
      attorneys’ fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Services, 
      and your breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) <b>Disclaimer.</b>
      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, 
      WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, 
      STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL 
      WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
      AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING 
      OR TRADE USAGE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, 
      ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOST OR 
      ALTERED.
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) <b>Limitations of Liability.</b>
      NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
      DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN 
      IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE 
      LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED ​​THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNT YOU 
      PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE 
      THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS 
      SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p>
      YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER 
      PROVISIONS:
    </p>

    <p>
      (a) <b>MANDATORY ARBITRATION.</b>
      You and Sizawi agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to 
      these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration,
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) <b>Informal Dispute Resolution.</b>
      We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal 
      legal action. Before filing a claim against Sizawi, you agree to try to 
      resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice at 
      richardwainainak@gmail.com of your name, a description of the dispute, 
      and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days,
      you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be 
      tolled during the 60-day resolution process. If you reside in the EU, 
      the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, 
      which you can access at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">
      https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) <b>Arbitration Forum.</b>
      Either party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an 
      alternative dispute resolution provider. You may have to pay our arbitration fees. 
      Sizawi will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless 
      the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
    </p>

    <p>
      (d) <b>Arbitration Procedures.</b>
      The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, 
      video conference, or in person in Nairobi, Kenya or at another mutually 
      agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR 
      Services under its then-prevailing rules. All issues are for the arbitrator 
      to decide, except a Kenyan court has the authority to determine (i) the 
      scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including 
      the mass filing procedures below, and (ii) whether you have complied with 
      the pre-arbitration requirements in this section. The amount of any settlement 
      offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the 
      arbitrator determines the final award, if any.
    </p>

    <p>
      (e) <b>Exceptions.</b>
      This arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following 
      claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii)
      injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of 
      the Services or intellectual property infringement.
    </p>

    <p>
      (f) <b>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</b>
      Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as 
      a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or 
      representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney 
      general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. 
      If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, 
      each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any 
      action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from 
      participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
    </p>

    <p>
      (g) <b>Severability.</b>
      If any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, 
      the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial 
      illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative
      arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in 
      this section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek 
      public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on 
      the substance of such claim from the arbitrator.
    </p>

    <h2>9. General Terms</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <b>Relationship of the Parties.</b>
      These terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship 
      between you and Sizawi or any of Sizawi's affiliates. Sizawi and you are 
      independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other
      or to incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other party's 
      prior written consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) <b>Use of Brands.</b>
      You may not use Sizawi’s or any of its affiliates’ names, logos, or trademarks,
      without our prior written consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) <b>Copyright Complaints.</b>
      If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, 
      please send notice to our address.
    </p>

    <p>
      (d) <b>Assignment and Delegation.</b>
      You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these 
      Terms, including in connection with a change of control. Any purported 
      assignment and delegation shall be null and void. We may assign these 
      Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or 
      substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of a 
      corporate reorganization.
    </p>

    <p>
      (e) <b>Modifications.</b>
      We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version
      on the website, or if an update materially adversely affects your rights 
      or obligations under these Terms we will provide notice to you either 
      by emailing the email associated with your account or providing an 
      in-product notification. Those changes will become effective no sooner 
      than 30 days after we notify you. All other changes will be effective 
      immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any change means 
      you agree to such change.
    </p>

    <p>
      (f) <b>Waiver and Severability.</b>
      If you do not comply with these Terms, and Sizawi does not take action 
      right away, this does not mean Sizawi is giving up any of our rights. 
      Except as provided in Section 8, if any part of these Terms is 
      determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent 
      jurisdiction, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent 
      permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other 
      terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      (g) <b>Equitable Remedies.</b>
      You acknowledge that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may 
      cause irreparable harm to Sizawi and its affiliates, and Sizawi shall 
      have the right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition 
      to any other legal remedies.
    </p>

    <p>
      (h) <b>Entire Agreement.</b>
      These Terms and any policies incorporated in these Terms contain 
      the entire agreement between you and Sizawi regarding the use of the 
      Services and, other than any Service specific terms of use or any 
      applicable enterprise agreements, supersedes any prior or 
      contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between 
      you and Sizawi on that subject.
