// so far I think I can get content scripts to work
/*
consider using the content script as an endpoint
all click events are relayed to it
Once it receives a click event,
  It'll check through storage api if user_media is set up
  if not: ask user for permission
  if yes: decided if to start or stop recording

  see if I can pass audio data through an event to popup file so an
  audio element is created
